## Description

Objective 
In this project, we'll introduce TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript by oddly adding static types. Let's explore the basics of TypeScript and how they relate to JavaScript. This class is aimed at developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.

What is TypeScript?
Typescript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.
It is a JavaScript extension that adds optional static typing features.

Why is it used?
Adds optional static typing, allowing developers to specify data types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
Helps detect type errors at compile time.
Improves code readability and facilitates maintenance.
Provides support for modern JavaScript features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions.
